# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**ymc-cronotimer** - A timer/chronometer application (project is currently in initial setup phase).

## Current State

This is a new repository. The codebase structure, build tools, and development workflow have not yet been established.

## Next Steps for Initial Setup

When setting up this project, typical decisions will need to be made regarding:

- **Technology stack**: Frontend framework (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.), backend if needed
- **Build tooling**: Vite, Webpack, or other bundler
- **Package manager**: npm, yarn, or pnpm
- **TypeScript vs JavaScript**
- **Testing framework**: Jest, Vitest, Playwright, etc.
- **Linting/formatting**: ESLint, Prettier configurations

This file should be updated once the project structure is established to include:
- Build commands (`npm run build`, `npm run dev`, etc.)
- Test execution commands
- Architecture overview once code structure is in place
- Any project-specific conventions or patterns
