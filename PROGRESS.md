   - ✅ Template creation DONE
   - ⏳ Workout archiving
   - ⏳ Template application to dates
   - ⏳ Bulk operations

3. **Start Feature #6: Sync & Collaboration**

## 📋 Features (Partial Implementation)

### 5. Library Management (Feature #5) - PARTIALLY COMPLETE ⏳
**Status**: Core features implemented, some advanced features pending

**Completed**:
- ✅ Search workouts by name
- ✅ Filter tabs (All, Today, Past, Templates)
- ✅ Workout duplication with full structure copy
- ✅ Save workout as template
- ✅ Context menu for workout actions
- ✅ Better library organization

**Pending**:

### 6. Sync & Collaboration (Feature #6)
- Multi-device sync via Supabase Realtime
- Concurrent editing conflict resolution
- Change notifications
- Optimistic UI updates

## 🐛 Known Issues

### High Priority:
1. Instructions could be clearer about how to use Remote + TV together
2. No offline support (PWA not configured)
3. No validation for workout data before save

### Medium Priority:
1. No retry logic for failed Supabase queries
2. No keyboard shortcuts
3. No optimistic updates for better perceived performance

### Low Priority:
1. Bundle size could be optimized (455KB / 131KB gzipped)
2. No workout search/filter in library
3. No workout templates yet

## 🔧 Technical Debt

### Code Quality:
- ✅ Error boundaries added
- ✅ Confirmation dialogs added
- Console.log errors could use proper toast notifications
- No retry logic for failed Supabase queries
- Limited TypeScript strict mode compliance

### Testing:
- No unit tests
- No integration tests
- No E2E tests
- Timer drift not tested

### Performance:
- Workout refresh queries load entire nested structure
- No query caching
- No optimistic updates
- Large bundle size (450KB)
